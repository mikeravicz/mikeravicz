- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikeravicz at the Eaton-Peabody Lab at Mass Eye & Ear in Boston <www.masseyeandear.org>, 
now part of Mass General Brigham hospital consortium (was Partners) and a Harvard teaching hospital.
- 👀 I have several interests: 
I am collaborating with Gabby Merchant and Denis Fitzpatrick at Boys Town on increasing the utility and use of Wideband Tympanometry as a clinical diagnostic tool;
I work with Sunil Puria's group at EPL using 3D LDV to study motion of middle-ear ossicles and tympanic membrane and OCT to study intracochlear motions;
I work with Heidi Nakajima's group to use OCT to study the human inner ear; and
I am part of the Engineering group at EPL with specialties in acoustics and vibration measurement and control and mechanical engineering in general.
I am the Shared Chamber Czar for the shared electrophysiology booths.
